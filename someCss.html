			<h3> My Tennis Experience </h3>
      <p> It was a great experience teaching tennis skill 
        for younger kids! I enjoyed showing them my
        techniques to play advanced tennis and be
        consistent rallying across the net.
        The last year of my Tennis Academy experience
        was a year to never forget. I would remember all 
        the great memories I had on the court from past
        academies. The last year of my Tennis Academy experience

      <h3>THIS IS ABOUT ME!</h3>
			<p> My name is Raymond W. Lam and my plan is to earn a Bachelors of Arts degree in Public Health. Also, my plan is to apply to the major in the sophomore year winter quarter. My goal is to do research in the health care field where I can study diseases and injuries that affect local communities in Washington State. I hope to work in a health care setting where I could advocate for health promotion, collaborate with medical experts in health organizations, and address awareness to global health threats by managing local programs.</span></p>

	  <p style="color: black" > One more unique CSS command that was not discussed in the workshop is that I changed my dotted border color to orange, changed the letter spacing to 2px, and changed the font size to 120% in "My Tennis Experience"</p>

      <p> At a young age, technology had surrounded me for many years. I love to interact, communicate, and learn any technology I used. With my first computer I downloaded multiple types of software, applications, and programs that caught my interest and learned everything that a computer can do.
